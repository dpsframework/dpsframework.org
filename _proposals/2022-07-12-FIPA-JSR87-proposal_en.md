# Section 2: Request
## 2.1 Please describe the proposed Specification:
This specification defines a set of objects and service interfaces to support the deployment and operation of autonomous communicative agents.

It is based upon the Abstract Architecture developed by FIPA, the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (see section 3.1). This Abstract Architecture defines how agents may register and discover each other, and how agents interact by exchanging intentional messages which are grounded in speech-act theory and first-order predicate logic.

The specification defines two kinds of entities:

>  Java classes for objects corresponding to the various elements of ACL (agent communication language) and SL (content language), as well as FIPA agent names and descriptions.
>  Java interfaces corresponding to the agent services for agent registration, discovery, and communication.

It is intended that the service interfaces may be implemented in terms of a number of different technologies, including both existing Java standards and proprietary systems. (In this respect the specification is similar to previous specifications such as JMS, the Java Message Service.)
## 2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)
It is highly desirable that this specification be usable for agent systems for a wide range of applications and target platforms. Therefore it is intended that the basic specifications should be usable on all Java platforms, from J2ME to J2EE. It is likely, however, that some instantiations of the specification will be based upon Java technologies that are restricted to particular Java platforms.
## 2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?
The autonomous communicative agent model has been adopted by many researchers and software developers, in application areas as diverse as e-commerce, process control, air traffic control, systems management, and workflow. The rate of adoption has been slowed by the lack of standards, and a concomitant lack of tools and optimized platform systems. The vast majority of agent-related work is being done in Java, and there is a significant demand for standard specifications in this area.
## 2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?
The Java programming language is well suited to the development of agent systems. However the rich set of data representations and platform services in Java means that independently developed agent systems are unlikely to interoperate. Furthermore the lack of standards has inhibited the development of agent-specific tools and components.
## 2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:
The FIPA Abstract Architecture covers two closely related areas:

>  The registration and location of agents
>  Communication between agents using asynchronous messages expressed in ACL, the FIPA agent communication language

In each of these areas, there are two kinds of specifications:

>  Services provided by an agent platform - a container in which an agent executes. These services may be implemented using a variety of underlying technologies. For example, agent message transport may be accomplished using HTTP, IIOP, or a proprietary mechanism; it may also be provided by a Java Message Service provider, such as IBM MQ-Series or Sun JMQ. The various services are defined as Java interfaces, which may be implemented by a variety of different agent platforms.
>  Java objects that define agent descriptions, agent messages, and the components of each. These objects are used in all implementations of the API. Different agents platforms and service implementations may require different types of serialization. Backward compatibility with FIPA97 systems will require the use of IIOP as a message transport and messages encoded using a LISP-like string syntax.

As in specifications such as JMS, the Java Agents API will not require or define mechanisms for interoperability between different types of agent platform.

At this point, it is anticipated that the specification may include the following elements:

>  Java classes for ACL (agent communication language) based on FIPA-ACL
>  Java classes for Agent naming
>  Java classes for Agent descriptions
>  Java interfaces for Agent Directory services
>  Java interfaces for Agent Messaging actions
>  Specification for the serialization of agent related objects (ACL, names, descriptions) in accordance with current FIPA specifications
>  Specification for the serialization of agent related objects (ACL, names, descriptions) in XML
>  Specification for a JNDI schema for Agent descriptions
>  Specification for the mapping of the Agent Messaging service in terms of the Java Message Service (JMS) specification
>  Specification for the mapping of the Agent Messaging service in terms of other transport services, such as IIOP and HTTP, using Java ORB services

## 2.6 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e. org.something, etc.)
javax.agent
## 2.7 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?
No
## 2.8 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?
As the JMS security model is likely to evolve with J2EE Ver.2 a revision for the agent model is likely to be required.
## 2.9 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?
No
## 2.10 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?
No

## 2.11 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this specification.

Initiation September 2000
Community draft July 2001

Public and Final drafts will be dependent upon the review process.

## 3.2 Explanation of how these items might be used as a starting point for the work.
The FIPA Abstract Architecture describes the basic services that must be provided by an agent platform, as well as the relationships between them. It also describes the agent communication language and content language. As its name implies, it presents these architectural elements as abstractions, independent of particular technologies, encodings, and so forth. As such, it is explicitly intended to be a starting point for concrete specifications such as that proposed by this JSR.
