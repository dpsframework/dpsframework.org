title:  'Proposal: compile and review Jess 8.0a1'
subtitle:  'Jess 8.0a1 revision proposal to be compiled with Java 1.8 at 32bit and with OpenJDK 11 or higher at 64bit.'
headtitle:  'Jess is a rule engine for the Java platform. To use it, you specify logic in the form of rules using one of two formats: the Jess rule language (prefered) or XML. You also provide some of your own data for the rules to operate on. When you run the rule engine, your rules are carried out. Rules can create new data, or they can do anything that the Java programming language can do. '
