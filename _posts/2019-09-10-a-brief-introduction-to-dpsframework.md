> **_Abstract:_** An informal description is given of five JADE Multiagent platform oriented micro-utilities. These micro-utilities have been developed in Java Language and they have two main functions: the first one has been to facilitate the deployment of complex-agents that belong to the replicas of a distributed application; the second one target has been to allow the configuration, adaptation and subsequent debugging of those agents at JADE Platform runtime. This set of open source micro-utilities has been named **_dpsFramework_**.

## 1. Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;The work environment named _dpsFramework_ consists of a set of micro-utilities developed in the _Java[^ORACLE]_ Language. These micro-utilities have been created with two main functions: the first one, to facilitate the deployment of complex agents or complex-agent communities that belong to the replicas of a distributed application; the second one, to allow the configuration, adaptation and subsequent debugging of agents at runtime. The _framework_, _launcher_, _generate_ and _shell_ belong to first group of _dpsFramework_ utility set. All of them are executed from the command-line of a terminal. This first group of utilities has the mission of creating the directory infrastructure of the replicas of the distributed application. In those replicas the knowledge of the agents of the application is stored. Each replica created with _dpsFramework_ can be deployed on one or more _Containers_ managed by the JADE[^TILAB] multi-agent platform on different servers. The properties incorporated by _dpsFramework_ to these replicas of the application allow the movement of complex-agent; including their accumulated knowledge and their inference and problem solving capabilities. With that capacity, the replicas of the application allow developers and architects to distribute processes in specialized agents or, to distribute the calculation loads generated by the heaviest reasoning.



&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of _dpsFramework_ utilities consists of an agent with a graphical interface enriched by Java SWING components and third-party components. This micro-utility has been called the _stage-node_ agent. It is intended to adhere to complex-agents under study and facilitate the editing of agent properties. With the agent _stage-node_ it is also possible to have access to the interpreters of the Java compiler, the JADE libraries and the inference engines of the agent under study.
